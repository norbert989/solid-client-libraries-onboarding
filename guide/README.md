# Introduction

Our data is collected and stored by big data vendors like `Facebook`, `Google`, `Amazon` and similar. What they can and can not do with our data is often hidden within long pages of terms and conditions. Even reading through this can take a considerable amount of time, but that is usually not enough to fully understand what the data will be used for due to various terms used.
Furthermore the data stored by these giants is accessible only to them alone and using it in a different application or with a different vendor often requires a lot of effort even if it is possible.
This has negative consequences on the privacy of our data while at the same time endangers the principle of universality on the webâ€¦ the web should be accessible to everyone.

Solid is a set of conventions and tools used to build decentralized apps.
With Solid, the data and the app are decoupled. The data lives in one place and the app reads and writes to that place. The user controls where that data is, and with which people or apps they want to share it with. Users can decide which apps to use based on which one suits their needs better, and they have full control of their data. 

This has many advantages for developers as well, because competition would be based on the quality of an app, as opposed to how much user data you control.
And for frontend developers there's the added bonus of not having to worry about setting up a database if you want to save user data.
